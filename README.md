# 💼 React Props Mini Project — Job Cards

A small, polished React mini-project built with **Vite** that demonstrates the **Props** concept by rendering reusable Job Card components using mock data.

This project is perfect for beginners to understand how data flows from a parent to child components and how to render lists dynamically using `.map()`.
